\begin{frame}[t]\frametitle{Motivation}
\begin{flushleft}
Adjoint methods provide a mechanism for propagating uncertainty and error in the system variables to the error in the desired quantity of interest (\qoi). In general these methods 
have the advantages
\begin{itemize}
\item No additional solves required to find the change in \qoi
\item Change in \qoi is found using a simple inner product
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
While computationally efficient, for transport memory usage may become an issue.
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires storing both the forward angular $\psi$ and adjoint angular $\psi^\dag$ fluxes
\item consider a quasi-diffusion approach to reduce the dimensionality, so only scalar fluxes are stored
\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}
\end{frame}
 
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Approach}
\begin{flushleft}
We will consider a simple transport system
\begin{itemize}
\item steady state, 1 group
\item isotropic sources and response functions
\item isotropic scattering
\item incident flux boundary conditions
\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}\frametitle{325
+Transport}
 \begin{flushleft}
To begin, consider the one-group SN transport system with isotropic source $q$ and scattering $\sigs$
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\label{SNfwd}
 \vO \cdot \grad \psi + \sigt \psi = \frac{\sigs}{4 \pi} \phi + \angSource
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\psi(\vr) = \psi^{ \text{inc}}(\vr) \quad \vr \in \partial V^{+} = \{  \vr \in \bound , \quad \vO \cdot \vec{n} < 0 \}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
We are concerned with a volumetric and isotropic \qoi given by $\scalResp$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\qoi 	&= \bra \phi , \scalResp \ket \equiv \int_V \phi \scalResp \, dV \\
		&= \braSN \psi , \scalResp \ketSN \equiv \int_V \int_\Omega \psi \scalResp \, d\Omega dV \\
\end{split}
\end{equation} 
\end{flushleft}
\end{frame}

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Transport}
 \begin{flushleft}
This presents the most straightforward (and most expensive) way to determine the change in the \qoi due to perturbations in the system parameters
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\label{SNfwdp}
\vO \cdot \grad \psi_p + ( \sigt \delta \sigt) \psi_p = \frac{\sigs+\delta \sigs}{4 \pi} \phi_p + \angSourcepd
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\psi(\vr) = \psi_p^{ \text{inc}}(\vr) \quad \vr \in \partial V^{+} = \{  \vr \in \bound , \quad \vO \cdot \vec{n} < 0 \}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Leading to the simple result
\begin{equation}
\delta \qoi = \bra \phi_p , \scalResp \ket - \bra \phi , \scalResp \ket = \bra \delta \phi , \scalResp \ket 
\end{equation} 
\end{flushleft}
\end{frame}

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
 
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Transport Adjoint}
 \begin{flushleft}
To avoid a forward solve for every perturbation case, an adjoint SN method may be employed. The adjoint system is defined
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
- \vO \cdot \grad \psi^\dag + \sigt \psi^\dag = \frac{\sigs}{4 \pi} \phi^\dag + \scalResp
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\psi^\dag(\vr) = \psi^{\dag \text{out}}(\vr)=0 \quad \vr \in \partial V^{+} = \{  \vr \in \bound , \quad \vO \cdot \vec{n} > 0 \}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Through the standard adjoint method a surface term is added in the \qoi
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\qoi &= \bra \phi^\dag , \angSource \ket - \sbraSN \psi^\dag , \psi \sketSN \\
&\equiv \bra \phi^\dag , \angSource \ket - \oint_{\partial V} \int_\Omega (\vO \cdot \vn) \psi^\dag  \psi \, d\Omega dS \\
\end{split}
\end{equation} 
\end{flushleft}
\end{frame}

 Multiply by the perturbed $\psi_p$ by $\scalResp$ and integrate. First order approximation used on last step.
\begin{equation}
\label{snSensPart}
\begin{split}
\qoi_p &=\braSN \psi_p , \angResp \ketSN \\
&=\braSN \psi_p , - \vO \cdot \grad \psi^\dag + \sigt \psi^\dag - \frac{\sigs}{4 \pi} \phi^\dag  \ketSN \\
&=\braSN  \vO \cdot \grad \psi_p + \sigt \psi_p - \frac{\sigs}{4 \pi} \phi_p , \psi^\dag  \ketSN - \sbraSN \psi_p, \psi^\dag \sketSN \\
&= \braSN  \vO \cdot \grad \psi_p + \sigma_{t,p}\psi_p - \delta\sigt\psi_p - \frac{\sigma_{s,p}}{4 \pi} \phi_p
+\frac{\delta \sigs}{4 \pi} \phi_p
 , \psi^\dag  \ketSN - \sbraSN \psi_p, \psi^\dag \sketSN \\
&\approx \braSN  \angSourcepd - \delta\sigt\psi_p + \frac{\delta \sigs}{4 \pi} \phi_p
 , \psi^\dag  \ketSN - \sbraSN \psi_p, \psi^\dag \sketSN
\end{split}

\end{frame}

 \begin{frame}\frametitle{Transport Adjoint}

Perform $\qoi_p - \qoi$ to obtain the change in $\qoi$
\begin{equation}
\label{snSens}
\begin{split}
\delta \qoi 
&\approx \braSN  \angSourced - \delta\sigt\psi_p + \frac{\delta \sigs}{4 \pi} \phi_p
 , \psi^\dag  \ketSN - \sbraSN \delta \psi, \psi^\dag \sketSN
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Pros
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not need SN solve for each perturbation scenario, just 2 SN solves to get $\psi$ and $\psi^\dag$
\end{itemize}
Cons
\begin{itemize}
\item Only first order perturbation accurate ($\delta \sigs \delta \phi=0$, $\delta \sigt \delta \phi=0$)
\item Need to store angular dependent $\psi$ and $\psi^\dag$, which can be prohibitive
\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{VET Transport}
 \begin{flushleft}
Formulate the P1 equations and define an Eddington Tensor $\Edd$ and a Boundary Eddington Factor $\BEdd$ 
\begin{equation}
\div \vec{J} + (\sigt-\sigs) \phi = \scalSource
, \quad \quad 
\div \left(  \int d\Omega \vO \vO \psi \right) + \sigt \vec{J} = 0 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\Edd(\vr)=\frac{\int d\Omega \vO \vO \psi(\vr,\vO)}{\phi(\vr)}
, \quad \quad 
\BEdd(\vr) = \frac{\int_{4 \pi} d\Omega \, | \vO \cdot \vn | \psi}{\phi(\vr)} , \, \vr \in \bound
\end{equation}
Combine into the VET transport formulation \cite{Miften}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\label{VEFForm}
- \div \left( \frac{1}{\sigt}\div \Edd \phi \right) + \siga \phi = \scalSource 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
2 J^{\text{inc}} = \BEdd \phi + \vn \cdot \frac{1}{\sigt} \div \Edd \phi 
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
\end{flushleft}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{VET Transport Adjoint}

Now an assumption is made that the $\Edd$ and $\BEdd$ remain unperturbed under system perturbation. Note $\ell_t = \frac{1}{\sigt}$
\begin{equation}
\label{VETSensDeriv}
\begin{split}
\qoi_p = &\bra \phi_p , \scalResp \ket \\
       = &\bra \phi_p , - \Edd : \left( \grad \isigt \grad \varphi^\dag \right) + \siga \vefadj \ket \\
=& \bra \scalSource + \delta \scalSource + \div \delta \isigt \div \left( \Edd \phi \right) - \delta \siga \phi, \vefadj \ket - \sbra \phi_p, \Edd \cdot \isigt \grad \vefadj \sket \\
&+ \sbra \vefadj, \isigt \div \Edd \phi_p \sket \\
=& \bra q, \vefadj \ket  + \bra \delta \scalSource + \div \delta \isigt \div \left( \Edd \phi \right)  - \delta \siga \phi, \vefadj \ket \\
& - \sbra \phi_p, \Edd \cdot \isigt \grad \vefadj \sket + \sbra \vefadj, \isigt \div \Edd \phi_p \sket 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{VET Transport Adjoint}
 \begin{flushleft}
 Subtracting off the unperturbed \qoi in Eq.~\eqref{adjVETqoi} and cleaning up some boundary terms results in
 \begin{equation}
\label{VETsens}
\begin{split}
\delta \qoi =&  \bra \delta \scalSource - \delta \siga \phi, \vefadj \ket  - \bra \delta \isigt \div \left( \Edd \phi \right) , \grad \vefadj \ket + \sbra \vefadj, 2 \delta J^{\text{inc}} \sket \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Pros
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires only 1 SN solve to get $\Edd$ and $\phi$, and 1 scalar VET solve for $\varphi^\dag$
\item No angular fluxes stored, only $\Edd$
\end{itemize}
Cons
\begin{itemize}
\item Only first order perturbation accurate (as was SN adjoint)
\item Major assumption that $\delta \Edd=0$, which is not always true. This means that the method in general is not exact for source perturbations $\delta q$ and $\delta \psi^{\text{inc}}$, which was the case for SN

\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}
\end{frame}
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}\frametitle{``Blended'' Approach}
 \begin{flushleft}
Form a $\delta \qoi$ inner-product by picking the exact source terms from SN adjoint Eq.~\eqref{snSens} and cross-section terms from VET adjoint Eq.~\eqref{VETsens}
\begin{equation}
\label{Blendsens}
\begin{split}
\delta \qoi =&  \textcolor{red}{\bra \angSourced , \phi^\dag \ket} \textcolor{blue}{- \bra \delta \siga \phi, \vefadj \ket - \bra \delta \isigt \div \left( \Edd \phi \right) , \grad \vefadj \ket} \textcolor{red}{
- \sbraSN \delta \psi^\text{inc}, \psi^\dag \sketSN }\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Pros
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires 2 SN solves to get $\Edd$, $\phi$ and $\phi^\dag$ then one VET solve for $\varphi^\dag$
\item No angular fluxes stored
\item Still exact for source perturbations (equivalent to SN adjoint)
\end{itemize}
Cons
\begin{itemize}
\item Lacks rigorous derivation
\item Could experience issues when both source and cross-section perturbation are present, compared to pure VET adjoint
\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Estimate $\delta \Edd$}
 \begin{flushleft}
Attempt to approximate by taking the slop with respect to perturbation parameters $\vp$
\begin{equation}
\delta \Edd \approx \frac{\partial \Edd}{\partial \vp} \cdot \delta \vp \approx \left( \frac{\Edd(\vp_1) - \Edd(\vp_0)}{\vp_1 - \vp_0} \right) \cdot \delta \vp
\end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
\label{VETsens}
\begin{split}
\delta \qoi =&  \bra \delta \scalSource - \delta \siga \phi, \vefadj \ket  - \bra \delta \isigt \div \left( \Edd \phi \right) , \grad \vefadj \ket + \sbra \vefadj, 2 \delta J^{\text{inc}} \sket \\
& - \bra  \isigt \div \left( \delta \Edd \phi \right), \grad \vefadj \ket
- \sbra \vefadj, \phi \delta \BEdd \sket
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Pros
\begin{itemize}
\item Attempts to resolve errors from the $\delta \Edd = 0$ assumption in VET adjoint
\end{itemize}
Cons
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires an additional SN solve for $\Edd(\vp_1)$. Pointless for only testing one perturbation scenario, potentially powerful for testing many perturbation scenarios
\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

Reverse the order of the VET derivation, start with adjoint P1 and work towards an alternate forward $\varphi$
\begin{equation}
\label{0amAlt}
-\div \vec{J}^\dag + (\sigt-\sigs) \phi^\dag  = 4\pi \scalResp 
, \quad \quad 
-\div \left(  \int d\Omega \vO \vO \psi^\dag  \right) + \sigt \vec{J}^\dag  = 0

\begin{equation}
\Edd^\dag(\vr)=\frac{\int d\Omega \vO \vO \psi^\dag(\vr,\vO)}{\phi^\dag(\vr)}

\BEdd(\vr) = \frac{\int_{4 \pi} d\Omega \, | \vO \cdot \vn | \psi^\dag}{\int_{4\pi} d\Omega \, \psi^\dag} \, \vr \in \bound

\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\label{TranAdjVEFForm}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Takeaways}
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{itemize}
\item All 4 VET formulations show ability to approximate $\delta \qoi$.

\item Blended method may be a quick refinement over the straightforward VET.

\item $\delta \Edd$ method appears to work quite well, but requires additional SN solves. Potentially useful for computing over a very large perturbation space.

\item The Alternate VET method using $\varphi$ can deal with source perturbations quite better than $\varphi^\dag$ VET methods. (At the expense of response $q^\dag$ perturbations.

\item The Alternate VET method shows issues with incident flux. May need to refine boundary conditions of the $\varphi$ equations.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Looking Forward}
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{itemize}
\item Extend tests to 2D/3D. Strong sensitivity to $\sigs$ is difficult to test in the 1D system. Inability to scatter ``around'' obstacles.
\item Potentially extend $\delta \Edd$ method to the $\varphi$ formulation.
\item Alternate boundary conditions for VET method.
\end{itemize}
