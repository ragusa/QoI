\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}  % Needs to be set to part, so the TOC doesnt add 'CHAPTER ' prefix in the TOC.
I would like to thank my advisor Professor Jean C. Ragusa for his invaluable help on this work and other academic endeavors. 
 
I would also like to extend my thanks to Professor Marvin L. Adams and Professor Bojan Popov for reviewing my work as members of my Masters committee.
