When testing
U·R noted that the R vector has the quadrature built into it --- i.e. quadrature integration was built in.
Where as int(u*r) form uses r values at points

Must use same BC for A and A*, sum(us*np.dot((As-A),u)) = 0

Found bug in my CN code making for/adj differ
	was related to use of ×tau vs ÷steps
